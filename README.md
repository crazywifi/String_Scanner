# String_Scanner


I've created another automation script that could simplify your work. Originally made for my own use in various scenarios.

The script is called "String Scanner.py"


Steps:

Double-click on 'StringsScanner.py'.

Select the folder you want to scan and wait.

For debugging purposes, you can utilize the 'Pathlogs.txt' file. It indicates which files have been scanned.

In the output folder, you'll find the results of the string scanning process.
